            for this jam was "Running out of Space" which was, for us, a literal understand of 
            what running out of space means. So, we decided to implemend a game with a top view 
            of an alien monster, The World Devourer, that will run nonstop to eat his preys. When 
            eating, the Devourer will grow up, increasing his length. The problem is that his 
            natural habitat are caves in a unexplored World where humans just arrived.`}
